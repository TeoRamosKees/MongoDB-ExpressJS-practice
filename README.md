# MongoDB and Express.js App

The purpose of forking this repository was to gain a deeper understanding 
of MongoDB and Express.js integration. The goal was to learn how to create 
a server API by defining routes and handling HTTP request methods such 
as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. It was fascinating to observe how these 
technologies interact within a Node.js environment.

## MongoDB
MongoDB serves as the NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data.
Express.js routes are used to interact with MongoDB, enabling the 
retrieval of data from the database or the insertion of new records.

## Express.js
Express.js is utilized as the server framework for handling HTTP requests.
It provides a convenient way to define routes and middleware, facilitating
the creation of robust APIs.

## Node.js
Node.js forms the foundation of the application stack, providing the runtime 
environment for executing JavaScript code on the server side.

By combining MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js (often referred to as 
the MEAN or MERN stack), we can create powerful and scalable web applications.
